The conversion is very simple and basically just means to open a plugin in the creation kit and re-save it. The link above goes to the Bethesda Launcher install file. Installation of the Creation Kit will be done using the Bethesda Launcher.\n Download and install the Bethesda.net Launcher Run the Launcher and sign in (create an account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one). Users should see the grey \u0026ldquo;Creation\u0026rdquo; icon on the left. Click on it and install. Users should now launch the CK, choose no to extracting the scripts, and close the program.  Create a new text file in the main game folder and name it CreationKitCustom.ini. Paste the following into the file:\n[Audio] bEnableAudio=1 [Grass] bAllowCreateGrass=1 bAllowLoadGrass=0 [General] bAllowMultipleMasterFiles=1 bAllowMultipleMasterLoads=1 [MESSAGES] bBlockMessageBoxes=1 [Archive] SResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices_en0.bsa, Skyrim - Textures0.bsa, Skyrim - Textures1.bsa, Skyrim - Textures2.bsa, Skyrim - Textures3.bsa, Skyrim - Textures4.bsa, Skyrim - Textures5.bsa, Skyrim - Textures6.bsa, Skyrim - Textures7.bsa, Skyrim - Textures8.bsa, Skyrim - Patch.bsa, Dawnguard.bsa, Hearthfires.bsa, Dragonborn.bsa SSE CreationKit Fixes Download   Download and extract the contents to the main game folder.\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable Download   Install vc_redist.x86.exe and vc_redist.x64.exe.\nUnlimited Bookshelves Patch Generator Download   This is a script for SSEEdit. Unzip the archive and place the content in the SSEEdit script folder (i.e. ..Modding/Tools/xEdit/Scripts/).\nCreate mod listings for output data To prevent output files generated by tools ending up in Mod Organizer\u0026rsquo;s overwrite folder, thus mixing with other files you might want to keep track of, it is advised to create empty mod listings in Mod Organizer for these types of files.\nCreate a separator to keep things tidy:\n Right click in the mods section of Mod Organizer 2. Select All Mods/Create Separator. Name the separator Output Data.  Create the output data folders:\n Right click in the mods section of Mod Organizer 2. Select All Mods/Create empty mod.

Repeat the steps, creating the following mod listings:\n SSEEdit Cache SSEEdit Backups BodySlide _Output Nemesis_Output Unlimited_Bookshelves_Patch_Generator_Output xLODGen_Output TextGen_Output DynDOLOD_Output Occlusion_Data  Some tools can be set to output data to these mod listings while other tools output data will have to be manually moved after each run. The tools that can output data directly into the output folders will be configured to do so in the next section.\nAdding executables All tools except BethINI should be launched through Mod Organizer. Mod Organizer may have auto-detected some tools but you need to confirm this and manually add the rest of the tools.\nInstructions to add tools as executables\n Click the Executables button at the top of the main Mod Organizer window. In the Title field type name of the tool. In the Binary field either type the path to the tools executable file or browse for it by selecting the \u0026hellip; button (i.e. ..Modding\\Tools[tool-folder][tool].exe). Input arguments in the Argument field. Arguments should be separated by spaces. Check the Use Application’s Icon for shortcuts box. Click the Apply button.  Repeat the steps for the executables listed below, filling in the appropriate data. The titles are suggestions.

Select Skyrim Special Edition from the game selection box. Allow BethINI to handle custom INIs, if prompted. Go to the Setup tab   Ensure the Game Path is correct (e.g., ..\\Modding\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition). Ensure the Mod Organizer path is correct (e.g., ..\\Modding\\Tools\\Mod Organizer 2). If the Mod Organizer path is correct, the INI Path menu will find the user’s profiles in MO2. Select the profile you use in Mod Organizer. If BethINI does not automatically find the profiles, browse to MO2\u0026rsquo;s Profile folder. For Instance users the profile will be stored in the user\u0026rsquo;s AppData folder (i.e. C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\ModOrganizer\\SkyrimSE\\profiles)   At this time BethINI should restart to grab the correct INI\u0026rsquo;s. Continue to customization.

To learn how to use MO2, watch the tutorial videos by Gamerpoet or read the STEP guide for Mod Organizer 2.\nSorting with LOOT At any time during the mod installation process LOOT should be used to sort plugin load order before running the game. This is necessary to ensure proper plugin priority (load order), which can have a dramatic impact on the game. Users not running the game during the mod installation step of the Guide can wait to sort after this step is complete. To sort with LOOT:\n Launch LOOT via Mod Organizer 2 from the executables drop-down menu. Click the “Sort” button at the top of the LOOT window. Examine the resulting order carefully and look for any alerts or warnings and take note of these. Ignore warnings about patches being available. Patches are provided by this guide. Click the “Apply” button, which has replaced the Sort button at the top. Close LOOT.  Standard cleaning procedure Some mods, as well as the official vanilla game, contains plugins (.esp-files) or master plugins (.esm-files) that are dirty. LOOT warns you about such plugins. Clean all plugins that LOOT prompts you to clean. To clean a plugin:\n Run xEdit64 Quick Auto Clean through Mod Organizer 2. Select the plugin being cleaned (i.e., Update.esm, Dawnguard.esm, etc). xEdit will now automatically clean the Identical to master and deleted records from the selected mod. Once xEdit is done cleaning, click the X in upper right of the program window to close the program.  Converting plugins Many plugins made for classic Skyrim works without issues with Skyrim Special Edition but the plugin form format (form 43) should be updated to Skyrim SE\u0026rsquo;s form format (form 44). To achieve this, simply open the plugin in the Creation Kit and re-save it.\nWhenever the guide prompts you to convert a plugin, follow these instructions:\n Run the Creation Kit through Mod Organizer 2. Select the File menu and choose Data\u0026hellip; Find the plugin to be converted and select Set as Active File. Note the Parent Masters listed and ensure they are checked (double-click the plugin listing to check it). Click OK and allow the Creation Kit to load the files. Once complete, simply save the plug (icon on toolbar or Save from the File menu). Close the Creation Kit.  Use SSEEdit to check that no errors were introduced in the plugin during the conversion:\n Run SSEEdit through Mod Organizer 2 Right-click in the plugin pane and choose Select None. Select the plugin being checked and click OK Allow SSEEdit to load and process all plugins. Right-click on the last plugin in the left pane (it should be the new plugin), and select Check for Errors.  The check should come back reading, \u0026ldquo;All done!\u0026quot;. If there are errors reported, reinstall the mod and redo the conversion.   Right-click on the plugin again and choose, Sort Masters. Close xEdit and be sure the plugin is checked in the saving prompt.

This ensures maximum stability and compatibility within the modding experience. This section of the guide walks you through three steps; creating an empty mod in MO2 for the cleaned files, cleaning the files and lastly moving the cleaned files to the created empty mod.\nCreate an empty mod  On the MO window, click the Open list options button at the top of the left pane, next to the profile selection drop-down. Choose Create empty mod, name it Cleaned Vanilla Masters, and click OK.  Clean the masters Vanilla masters should be cleaned in the following order:\n Update.esm Dawnguard.esm Hearthfires.esm Dragonborn.esm  Follow the standard cleaning procedures to clean Update.esm, followed by Dawnguard.esm. Once Dawnguard is cleaned, complete the manual cleaning below:\n Run SSEEdit from MO2. At the prompt, double-click on Dawnguard.esm. Once loaded, type in 00016BCF in the FormID field (above the mod list) and hit Enter/Return. In the right pane, find the XEZN - Encounter Zone record. In the Dawnguard.esm column, right-click on the RiftenRatwayZone [ECZN:0009FBB9] entry and select Remove.  If a prompt appears select Yes for each of these removals.   In the FormID field again, type in 0001FA4C and hit Enter/Return. On the Dawnguard.esm column, right-lick on the Dawnguard.esm header and select Remove. In the FormID field again, type in 0006C3B6 and hit Enter/Return. On the Dawnguard.esm column, right-lick on the Dawnguard.esm header and select Remove. Now close SSEEdit, ensuring Dawnguard.esm is checked on the prompt.  Once Dawnguard\u0026rsquo;s manual cleaning is complete, follow the standard cleaning procedures to clean Hearthfires.esm, and then last, Dragonborn.esm.\nMoving the cleaned files After the vanilla master files are cleaned, users should move them to their created mod listing in MO2 and restore the original files. This prevents users from having to re-clean the files after verifying their cache in Steam. To do this, complete the following:\n In a new window, open the Skyrim Special Edition Data directory (e.g. ..\\Modding\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition\\Data) Drag and drop (or copy and paste) the four cleaned master files from Data to the Cleaned Vanilla Masters folder. In the SSEEdit Backups folder, rename the files to their original names (e.g. Update.esm, etc).  If there are multiple copies of any of the files, use the one with the earliest timestamp.   Drag and drop the renamed files from the xEdit Backups folder to the Data directory and choose to overwrite/replace, if asked. Close the explorer windows. Drag and drop the new Cleaned Vanilla Masters mod listing in the left pane directly below DLC: Dragonborn.esm.  At this point, the Bethesda masters should be cleaned and the mod list order should reflect:\n DLC: Dawnguard.esm DLC: HearthFires.esm DLC: Dragonborn.esm Cleaned Vanilla Masters  "},{"uri":"https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/introduction/guide-features/","title":"Guide features","tags":[],"description":"Descriptions of guide features like search and table of contents.","content":"How to use the guide and basic information Hugo and Learn The site is built using Hugo.

They are well integrated into the game, but old players might be confused when some aspects of the game behaves differently to what they are used to.\nSkills and experience Skills are leveled up in the same manner as in vanilla Skyrim, you level up skills by using them repeatedly. In vanilla Skyrim you gain experience to level up your characters main level by leveling up skills. To level up your character using this build, you will need to earn experience mainly by completing quests and by discovering new places. This is made possible by the mod Experience. An optional patch tweaks skills leveling and character leveling speed to be 50% slower than before to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to experience all new quests, both small or dlc-sized, before maxing out your characters level.\nClasses Class Overhaull Re-Imagined introduces a class system that will present classes and specializations to the player when certain conditions are met.\nSimons Magus\u0026rsquo;s suite The guide uses a suite of mods by SimonMagus616 that enhances and tweaks every aspect of character building like vampire and werewolf gameplay, perks, standing stones, magic, combat and races. The whole suit of mods has a vanilla plus feel, like a better vanilla experience.\nEncounter zones The encounter zones in Skyrim now has a minimum level set thanks to another mod by SimonMagus616, Arena. Enemies in most areas in vanilla Skyrim matches the player level up to a certain level. Arena removes the upper limit to make sure that enemies keeps up with the player level to ensure that the game will provide a challange at higher player levels. Arena also sets a minimum level to areas (or encounter zones) based on the enemy types that spawns in the area. It uses the following formula:\nLevel 05: Bandits Level 10: Draugr, Animals, Spriggans Level 15: Mages, Forsworn Level 20: Falmer, Dwarves Level 25: Vampires, Giants, Dragon Lairs Level 30: Dragon Priest Dungeons, Daedra To make sure that side quests doesn\u0026rsquo;t send you to too dangerous areas, the guide uses the mod Radiant Requirements. Radiant Requirements removes the more dangerous quest locations from lower level player characters available radiant quests.\nWeapons, armors \u0026amp; clothing Several mods adds armors, weapons and clothes to the game. These are all tweaked and patched for balance and consistency. The mod More Craftable Equipment adds looms to the game at which you can craft clothes using the new ingredient thread. Threads are crafted at this newly introduced loom. The mod Cloaks of Skyrim adds cloaks and capes as well as a spinning wheel where these cloaks and capes are crafted. The guide tweaks the spinning wheel to only be able to craft threads. All cloaks and capes are tweaked to be crafted using the loom from More Craftable Equipment and has their crafting recipes tweaked to use the new ingredient thread. Even more cloaks are added by the mod Winter is coming.

You can create separators in Mod Organizer to separate sections of mods, preferably using the names from the mod sections in the guide. Always install the main, update and hotfix file(s), unless the guide tells you otherwise. The recommended resolutions of textures are just recommendations. You may install higher resolution versions of the mods if your computer can handle it. If LOOT tells you to clean a mod, clean it.  The provided guide patches comes with a neat FOMOD installer that automatically chooses what to install. The patches consists of a huge bunch of esl-flagged plugins. Since they are esl-flagged you do not have to worry about the old plugin count limit. Keeping the patches separated in different plugins helps during development when adding, testing and replacing mods. This also makes this mod list mostly modular. There are a few exceptions:\n You need to use the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch Cloaks of Skyrim and Winter is coming should be used together or not at all for the patches to work.  Theoretically, you can leave out any other mod from your install.\n Extenders   Resources   Foundation   Animation \u0026amp; Effects   Models \u0026amp; Textures   Sounds \u0026amp; Music   Creature Skeleton   Character Appearance   Fixes   User Interface   Items   Gameplay   New Characters   Lighting \u0026amp; Weather   Locations   ENB   ENB Presets   Patches   Utilities   LOD generation textures   "},{"uri":"https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/mod-installation/models-textures/","title":"Models &amp; Textures","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Alpine Forest of Whiterun Valley Download   aMidianBorn Book of Silence SE Download   Download and install the optional files:\n  aMidianBorn book of silence_ARMORS\n Custom Iron and baded: Iron - Vanilla Cut Steel: Steel Steel Plate: Steel Plate Leather: Leather Hide and Studded: Hide Fur: Fur Elven: Gold Dwarwen: Dwarwen Ancient Nord: Ancient Nord Orcish: Orcish Scaled: Scaled Wolf: Wolf - Grey Fur Glass: Glass - Golden Ebony - Ebony - Black Blades: Blades Falmer: Falmer    aMidianBorn book of silence_DRAGONBORN DLC\n Custom  Nordic Carved Armor: Black Fur Bonemold Armor Acolyte Masks Ash Spawn Ash Guardians      aMidianBorn book of silence_UNIQUE ITEMS\n Custom:  Target of the blooded Wuuthrad Savior\u0026rsquo;s hide: Savior\u0026rsquo;s Hide Helm of Yngol Mace of Molag Bal Mehrune\u0026rsquo;s Razor Volendrung Tsun\u0026rsquo;s Armor Ebony Mail: Ebony Mail - Black Staff of Magnus      aMidianBorn book of silence_WEAPONS\n Install all weapons    Hide the following files/folders:\n aMidianborn_Skyforge_Weapons.esp  aMidianBorn stormcloak officer armour Download   Arctic - Frost Effects Redux Download   Install the main file using the following options:\n Resolution: Lite Color: Realistic hue Size: x.5 Style: Standard Plugin option: Frost mesh patch (esl-tagged)  Armor Mesh Fixes SE Download   Download and install the main file, the update file and the Blades Helmet - aMidianBorn Patch optional file.\nArri\u0026rsquo;s Snow Elf Ruins Retexture Special Edition Download   Barenziah\u0026rsquo;s Glory SE Download   Recommended install options:\n Desaturated Crown Texture - 1k Gamwich Jewelrybox Texture - 1k Gamwich Gem Texture - dark  Bellyaches Animal and Creature Pack SSE Download   Recommended install options:\n  Options\n Options: Custom Install    Custom\n Bear (brown and black): Bear Replacers Chaurus: None Chicken: Brown Dog: HD Default Dragonfly: Select Nothing Deer: Deer replacers Fox (Red): Red Fox (Arctic): Arctic Frostbite Spider (Brown): None Frostbite Spider (Arctic): None Goat: None Hawk: None Highland Cow: Orange Horker: Grey    Horse Options\n Horse Tails: None Horse Textures: None    More Custom Options\n Mammoth: None Mudcrab: None Rabbit: Rabbit Replacer Sabre Cat (Brown): None Sabre Cat (Arctic): None Skeever (Grey): Mangy - Dark Grey Skeever (Arctic): Mangy - Grey Hooded Wolf (Black): Darker Black Wolf (Ice): White (Brown Eyes) Wolf (Red): Brown Werewolf: Dark Grey Werewolf Eyes: Normal Brown    Bent Pines II Download   Better Dynamic Ash SE Download   Better Dynamic Snow SE Download   In the installer, choose:\n Plugin Installation: Brighter Snow Materials Projected Diffuse Texture: None Optional Addons: None  BetterFalmerCaveCeilingGlow Download   Book Covers Skyrim (SE) Download   Choose whatever options you like, desaturated books are recommended.\nBook Covers Skyrim - Lost Library (SE) Download   Choose whatever options you like, desaturated books are recommended.\nDark Brotherhood Tenets Restored (SE) Download   Recommendation: 1K\nDeadly Spell Impacts (SE) Download   Recommended install options:\n Options: Custom Custom: One Fire Impact (Default) One: Fire: Default Frost: Alternate 1 Lightning: Default  Deathbell HD Download   Recommendation: 1K\nDesigns of the Nords SE Download   In the installer, install optionals if that is desired.\nDragon Masks Retextured SE (4K - 2K) Download   Recommendation: 2K\nDRAGON PRIEST Download   Recommendation: 2K full option\nFrankly HD Dragonbone and Dragonscale - Armor and Weapons HQ Download   Recommendation: 2K\nInstall both main and update file.\nDragonbone Mastery - Weapons Retexture Download   Use with or without engravings and install with the following recommended options:\n Main weapon textures: Darker bone Arrow options: New style arrows Scabbard style: Full Length scabbard Full Sized Scabbard Texture Options: Traditional Design Full Sized Scabbard Mesh Optional: Transparent Meshes  The installer for this mod contains an error, which Mod Organizer will let you know during the installation.
