The system setup guide ensures that all game files are fresh and prompts you to create a basic modding folder structure to install tools into. This guide uses the folder structure from the system setup guide in its instructions. Users that deviates from the system setup guide needs to be aware of this and adjust the instructions accordingly to their installation and modding paths.\nFolder structure\nc:\\ └── Modding\\ │ └── Tools\\ ...Steam\\ │ └──steamapps\\ │ └──common\\ │ └──Skyrim Special Edition\\ │ └──Data\\ Common folders referred to in this guide\n Tools folder: c:\\Modding\\Tools\\ Main game folder: \u0026hellip;\\Steam\\Steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition Data folder: \u0026hellip;\\Steam\\Steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition\\Data  After following the system setup guide you will have a clean installation of Skyrim and the following tools installed and configured:\n BethINI DynDOLOD LOOT Mod Organizer xEdit (also xrefered to as TES5Edit or SSEEdit) xLODGen (also refered to as TES5LODGen or SSELODGen)  When you install DynDOLOD, choose DynDOLOD 3.00. None of the main files are needed at this point.\n Additional tools installations and setups Complete the system setup by installing the following tools:\nCreation Kit Download   The Creation Kit is needed to convert plugins made for Skyrim to work with Skyrim Special Edition. The conversion is very simple and basically just means to open a plugin in the creation kit and re-save it. The link above goes to the Bethesda Launcher install file. Installation of the Creation Kit will be done using the Bethesda Launcher.\n Download and install the Bethesda.net Launcher Run the Launcher and sign in (create an account if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one). Users should see the grey \u0026ldquo;Creation\u0026rdquo; icon on the left. Click on it and install. Users should now launch the CK, choose no to extracting the scripts, and close the program.  Create a new text file in the main game folder and name it CreationKitCustom.ini. Paste the following into the file:\n[Audio] bEnableAudio=1 [Grass] bAllowCreateGrass=1 bAllowLoadGrass=0 [General] bAllowMultipleMasterFiles=1 bAllowMultipleMasterLoads=1 [MESSAGES] bBlockMessageBoxes=1 [Archive] SResourceArchiveList2=Skyrim - Voices_en0.bsa, Skyrim - Textures0.bsa, Skyrim - Textures1.bsa, Skyrim - Textures2.bsa, Skyrim - Textures3.bsa, Skyrim - Textures4.bsa, Skyrim - Textures5.bsa, Skyrim - Textures6.bsa, Skyrim - Textures7.bsa, Skyrim - Textures8.bsa, Skyrim - Patch.bsa, Dawnguard.bsa, Hearthfires.bsa, Dragonborn.bsa SSE CreationKit Fixes Download   Download and extract the contents to the main game folder.\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable Download   Install vc_redist.x86.exe and vc_redist.x64.exe.\nUnlimited Bookshelves Patch Generator Download   This is a script for SSEEdit. Unzip the archive and place the content in the SSEEdit script folder (i.e. ..Modding/Tools/xEdit/Scripts/).\nCreate mod listings for output data To prevent output files generated by tools ending up in Mod Organizer\u0026rsquo;s overwrite folder, thus mixing with other files you might want to keep track of, it is advised to create empty mod listings in Mod Organizer for these types of files.\nCreate a separator to keep things tidy:\n Right click in the mods section of Mod Organizer 2. Select All Mods/Create Separator. Name the separator Output Data.  Create the output data folders:\n Right click in the mods section of Mod Organizer 2. Select All Mods/Create empty mod. Name the mod.  Repeat the steps, creating the following mod listings:\n SSEEdit Cache SSEEdit Backups BodySlide _Output Nemesis_Output Unlimited_Bookshelves_Patch_Generator_Output xLODGen_Output TextGen_Output DynDOLOD_Output Occlusion_Data  Some tools can be set to output data to these mod listings while other tools output data will have to be manually moved after each run. The tools that can output data directly into the output folders will be configured to do so in the next section.\nAdding executables All tools except BethINI should be launched through Mod Organizer. Mod Organizer may have auto-detected some tools but you need to confirm this and manually add the rest of the tools.\nInstructions to add tools as executables\n Click the Executables button at the top of the main Mod Organizer window. In the Title field type name of the tool. In the Binary field either type the path to the tools executable file or browse for it by selecting the \u0026hellip; button (i.e. ..Modding\\Tools[tool-folder][tool].exe). Input arguments in the Argument field. Arguments should be separated by spaces. Check the Use Application’s Icon for shortcuts box. Click the Apply button.  Repeat the steps for the executables listed below, filling in the appropriate data. The titles are suggestions. Users that deviate from the recommended install paths need to adjust the arguments accordingly.\nTools\n DynDOLOD SE  Title: DynDOLOD SE Executable: DynDOLOD64.exe Arguments:  -SSE -o:c:\\Modding\\Tools\\DynDOLOD_Output     LOOT  Title: LOOT Executable: LOOT.exe Arguments: \u0026ndash;game=\u0026ldquo;Skyrim Special Edition\u0026rdquo;   SSEEdit  Title: SSEEdit Executable: SSEEdit.exe Arguments:  -IKnowWhatImDoing -B:\u0026ldquo;c:\\Modding\\Tools\\Mod Organizer 2\\mods\\SSEEdit Backups\u0026rdquo; -C:\u0026ldquo;c:\\Modding\\Tools\\Mod Organizer 2\\mods\\SSEEdit Cache\u0026rdquo;     xLODGen  Title: xLODGen Executable: xLODGen64.exe Arguments:  -sse -o:\u0026ldquo;c:\\Modding\\xLODGen\\xLODGen_Output\u0026quot;     SSEEdit Quick Auto Clean (installed with SSEEdit)  Title: SSEEdit Quick Auto Clean Executable: SSEEditQuickAutoClean.exe Arguments:   TexGen SE (installed with DynDOLOD)  Title: TexGen SE Executable: TexGen64.exe Arguments:  -SSE -o:c:\\Modding\\Tools\\TextGen_Output      Note that you need to check that the paths in the given arguments are valid for your install paths.\n BethINI Setup BethINI needs to be run for the current profile in Mord Organizer and ran to establish the INI\u0026rsquo;s before beginning the mod installations.\nInitialization  Close Mod Organizer and run BethINI. Select Skyrim Special Edition from the game selection box. Allow BethINI to handle custom INIs, if prompted. Go to the Setup tab   Ensure the Game Path is correct (e.g., ..\\Modding\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition). Ensure the Mod Organizer path is correct (e.g., ..\\Modding\\Tools\\Mod Organizer 2). If the Mod Organizer path is correct, the INI Path menu will find the user’s profiles in MO2. Select the profile you use in Mod Organizer. If BethINI does not automatically find the profiles, browse to MO2\u0026rsquo;s Profile folder. For Instance users the profile will be stored in the user\u0026rsquo;s AppData folder (i.e. C:\\Users\\UserName\\AppData\\Local\\ModOrganizer\\SkyrimSE\\profiles)   At this time BethINI should restart to grab the correct INI\u0026rsquo;s. Continue to customization.  Customization Close Mod Organizer and run BethINI if it isn\u0026rsquo;t open already.\nUse the following settings:\nBasic tab\nIn the presets section:\n Click Default button. Click High button.

To learn how to use MO2, watch the tutorial videos by Gamerpoet or read the STEP guide for Mod Organizer 2.\nSorting with LOOT At any time during the mod installation process LOOT should be used to sort plugin load order before running the game. This is necessary to ensure proper plugin priority (load order), which can have a dramatic impact on the game. Users not running the game during the mod installation step of the Guide can wait to sort after this step is complete. To sort with LOOT:\n Launch LOOT via Mod Organizer 2 from the executables drop-down menu. Click the “Sort” button at the top of the LOOT window. Examine the resulting order carefully and look for any alerts or warnings and take note of these. Ignore warnings about patches being available. Patches are provided by this guide. Click the “Apply” button, which has replaced the Sort button at the top. Close LOOT.  Standard cleaning procedure Some mods, as well as the official vanilla game, contains plugins (.esp-files) or master plugins (.esm-files) that are dirty. LOOT warns you about such plugins. Clean all plugins that LOOT prompts you to clean. To clean a plugin:\n Run xEdit64 Quick Auto Clean through Mod Organizer 2. Select the plugin being cleaned (i.e., Update.esm, Dawnguard.esm, etc). xEdit will now automatically clean the Identical to master and deleted records from the selected mod. Once xEdit is done cleaning, click the X in upper right of the program window to close the program.  Converting plugins Many plugins made for classic Skyrim works without issues with Skyrim Special Edition but the plugin form format (form 43) should be updated to Skyrim SE\u0026rsquo;s form format (form 44). To achieve this, simply open the plugin in the Creation Kit and re-save it.\nWhenever the guide prompts you to convert a plugin, follow these instructions:\n Run the Creation Kit through Mod Organizer 2. Select the File menu and choose Data\u0026hellip; Find the plugin to be converted and select Set as Active File. Note the Parent Masters listed and ensure they are checked (double-click the plugin listing to check it). Click OK and allow the Creation Kit to load the files. Once complete, simply save the plug (icon on toolbar or Save from the File menu). Close the Creation Kit.  Use SSEEdit to check that no errors were introduced in the plugin during the conversion:\n Run SSEEdit through Mod Organizer 2 Right-click in the plugin pane and choose Select None. Select the plugin being checked and click OK Allow SSEEdit to load and process all plugins. Right-click on the last plugin in the left pane (it should be the new plugin), and select Check for Errors.  The check should come back reading, \u0026ldquo;All done!\u0026quot;. If there are errors reported, reinstall the mod and redo the conversion.   Right-click on the plugin again and choose, Sort Masters. Close xEdit and be sure the plugin is checked in the saving prompt.  "},{"uri":"https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/preparations/cleaning/","title":"Cleaning","tags":[],"description":"Instructions on how to clean the vanilla files.","content":"Cleaning vanilla master files To remove redundancy and errors in Skyrim\u0026rsquo;s master plugins, it is recommended they be cleaned with SSEEdit before modding begins. This ensures maximum stability and compatibility within the modding experience. This section of the guide walks you through three steps; creating an empty mod in MO2 for the cleaned files, cleaning the files and lastly moving the cleaned files to the created empty mod.\nCreate an empty mod  On the MO window, click the Open list options button at the top of the left pane, next to the profile selection drop-down. Choose Create empty mod, name it Cleaned Vanilla Masters, and click OK.  Clean the masters Vanilla masters should be cleaned in the following order:\n Update.esm Dawnguard.esm Hearthfires.esm Dragonborn.esm  Follow the standard cleaning procedures to clean Update.esm, followed by Dawnguard.esm. Once Dawnguard is cleaned, complete the manual cleaning below:\n Run SSEEdit from MO2. At the prompt, double-click on Dawnguard.esm. Once loaded, type in 00016BCF in the FormID field (above the mod list) and hit Enter/Return. In the right pane, find the XEZN - Encounter Zone record. In the Dawnguard.esm column, right-click on the RiftenRatwayZone [ECZN:0009FBB9] entry and select Remove.  If a prompt appears select Yes for each of these removals.   In the FormID field again, type in 0001FA4C and hit Enter/Return. On the Dawnguard.esm column, right-lick on the Dawnguard.esm header and select Remove. In the FormID field again, type in 0006C3B6 and hit Enter/Return. On the Dawnguard.esm column, right-lick on the Dawnguard.esm header and select Remove. Now close SSEEdit, ensuring Dawnguard.esm is checked on the prompt.  Once Dawnguard\u0026rsquo;s manual cleaning is complete, follow the standard cleaning procedures to clean Hearthfires.esm, and then last, Dragonborn.esm.\nMoving the cleaned files After the vanilla master files are cleaned, users should move them to their created mod listing in MO2 and restore the original files. This prevents users from having to re-clean the files after verifying their cache in Steam. To do this, complete the following:\n In a new window, open the Skyrim Special Edition Data directory (e.g. ..\\Modding\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Skyrim Special Edition\\Data) Drag and drop (or copy and paste) the four cleaned master files from Data to the Cleaned Vanilla Masters folder. In the SSEEdit Backups folder, rename the files to their original names (e.g. Update.esm, etc).  If there are multiple copies of any of the files, use the one with the earliest timestamp.   Drag and drop the renamed files from the xEdit Backups folder to the Data directory and choose to overwrite/replace, if asked. Close the explorer windows. Drag and drop the new Cleaned Vanilla Masters mod listing in the left pane directly below DLC: Dragonborn.esm.  At this point, the Bethesda masters should be cleaned and the mod list order should reflect:\n DLC: Dawnguard.esm DLC: HearthFires.esm DLC: Dragonborn.esm Cleaned Vanilla Masters  "},{"uri":"https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/introduction/guide-features/","title":"Guide features","tags":[],"description":"Descriptions of guide features like search and table of contents.","content":"How to use the guide and basic information Hugo and Learn The site is built using Hugo.

They are well integrated into the game, but old players might be confused when some aspects of the game behaves differently to what they are used to.\nSkills and experience Skills are leveled up in the same manner as in vanilla Skyrim, you level up skills by using them repeatedly. In vanilla Skyrim you gain experience to level up your characters main level by leveling up skills. To level up your character using this build, you will need to earn experience mainly by completing quests and by discovering new places. This is made possible by the mod Experience. An optional patch tweaks skills leveling and character leveling speed to be 50% slower than before to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to experience all new quests, both small or dlc-sized, before maxing out your characters level.\nClasses Class Overhaull Re-Imagined introduces a class system that will present classes and specializations to the player when certain conditions are met.\nSimons Magus\u0026rsquo;s suite The guide uses a suite of mods by SimonMagus616 that enhances and tweaks every aspect of character building like vampire and werewolf gameplay, perks, standing stones, magic, combat and races. The whole suit of mods has a vanilla plus feel, like a better vanilla experience.\nEncounter zones The encounter zones in Skyrim now has a minimum level set thanks to another mod by SimonMagus616, Arena. Enemies in most areas in vanilla Skyrim matches the player level up to a certain level. Arena removes the upper limit to make sure that enemies keeps up with the player level to ensure that the game will provide a challange at higher player levels. Arena also sets a minimum level to areas (or encounter zones) based on the enemy types that spawns in the area. It uses the following formula:\nLevel 05: Bandits Level 10: Draugr, Animals, Spriggans Level 15: Mages, Forsworn Level 20: Falmer, Dwarves Level 25: Vampires, Giants, Dragon Lairs Level 30: Dragon Priest Dungeons, Daedra To make sure that side quests doesn\u0026rsquo;t send you to too dangerous areas, the guide uses the mod Radiant Requirements. Radiant Requirements removes the more dangerous quest locations from lower level player characters available radiant quests.\nWeapons, armors \u0026amp; clothing Several mods adds armors, weapons and clothes to the game. These are all tweaked and patched for balance and consistency. The mod More Craftable Equipment adds looms to the game at which you can craft clothes using the new ingredient thread. Threads are crafted at this newly introduced loom. The mod Cloaks of Skyrim adds cloaks and capes as well as a spinning wheel where these cloaks and capes are crafted. The guide tweaks the spinning wheel to only be able to craft threads. All cloaks and capes are tweaked to be crafted using the loom from More Craftable Equipment and has their crafting recipes tweaked to use the new ingredient thread. Even more cloaks are added by the mod Winter is coming. These cloaks are crafted at the tanning rack since they are crafted from pelts.\n"},{"uri":"https://dreadflopp.github.io/dreadsskyrimbuild/mod-installation/lod-generation-textures/","title":"LOD generation textures","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The mods in this section will be deactivated once LOD has been generated.\nCathedral landscapes LOD generation textures Download   If you intend to use The Grass Must Grow, these LOD generation textures are redundant.

You can create separators in Mod Organizer to separate sections of mods, preferably using the names from the mod sections in the guide. Always install the main, update and hotfix file(s), unless the guide tells you otherwise. The recommended resolutions of textures are just recommendations. You may install higher resolution versions of the mods if your computer can handle it. If LOOT tells you to clean a mod, clean it.  The provided guide patches comes with a neat FOMOD installer that automatically chooses what to install. The patches consists of a huge bunch of esl-flagged plugins. Since they are esl-flagged you do not have to worry about the old plugin count limit. Keeping the patches separated in different plugins helps during development when adding, testing and replacing mods. This also makes this mod list mostly modular. There are a few exceptions:\n You need to use the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch Cloaks of Skyrim and Winter is coming should be used together or not at all for the patches to work.
