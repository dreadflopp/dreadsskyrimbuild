###### How to use the guide and basic information

## Hugo and Learn

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The site's theme is a heavily modified version of the Hugo theme [Learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/).

## Color themes

There are two color themes to choose from, STEP and Light. STEP is a dark them while Light is, surprise, a light theme. More themes might be added at a later time.

## Basic navigation

To start using the guide, follow each section in order starting from the top of the navigation menu on the left hand side of the screen. The menu will be hidden on small screens (like phones) but can be revealed by pressing the menu button that is placed first in the breadcrumb row. The breadcrumb row shows the current page's location in the site's hierarchy.

## Table of contents

The *table of contents* is shown by clicking the table of contents button located in the breadcrumb row. This table shows a list of headlines from the current page to allow quick navigation within a page.

## Search

The guide features a search function that allows for quick navigation and searches.
