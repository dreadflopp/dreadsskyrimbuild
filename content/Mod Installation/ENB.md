It is up to you if you want to use an ENB or not. If you already have a problem getting a high enough framerate, you should probably not use an ENB. ENB's enhances visuals, but I do not use one in my own setup. I always find places in the game world where the lightning gets too strong or weak, which puts me off. The game looks good without an ENB.
