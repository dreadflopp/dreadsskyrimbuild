If you intend to use *The Grass Must Grow*, these LOD generation textures are redundant. If this is the case, do not install this mod

Install *LODGEN Textures for v3*.

**Do not merge with the Cathedral landscapes main file that was installed in the Foundational Mods section.**

Download the recommended optional *SSE-Terrain-Tamriel.esm* listed at the end of the first post. Create an empty mod in Mod Organizer 2 and place the downloaded file inside.
