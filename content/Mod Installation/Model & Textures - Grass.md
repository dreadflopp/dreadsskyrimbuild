The grass included in *Cathedral Landscapes* is very performance friendly, but unfortunately it doesn't look very good when used alongside an ENB with detailed shadows enabled. These mods installs better looking grass that looks good with an ENB preset, but at the cost of performance. If your computer can handle it, installing these mods is recommended whether you use an ENB or not.
